# mtc-dev-repo-README
This is a README for the terraform cloud deployment of the compute and networking repos terraform-aws-networking and terraform-aws-compute. The terraform cloud configuration designer is used to create the main.tf which is deployed to a real time mtc-dev-repo created on terraform apply of a main.tf controller file on Cloud9 IDE.
